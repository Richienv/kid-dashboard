Highly Requested / Community-Built "Next-Level" FeaturesObservability & Decision Tracing Dashboard
Real-time view of every agent decision, tool call, prompt chain, and reasoning step (not just final outputs). One popular open-source plugin shows token spend, tool executions, and full traces in a clean UI—super useful for debugging why the agent did something weird or expensive. (Multiple people built variants over weekends using Next.js/Shadcn.)
Friendly Log Viewer / Chat-Style Interface
Instead of raw JSON logs, transform them into a readable chat-like feed (e.g., "Agent decided to call email skill → fetched 12 unread → summarized & archived"). Several GitHub repos offer local dashboards that parse logs this way for easier monitoring.
Personal Metrics / "CEO Overview" Dashboard
People connect their own life data (e.g., health trackers, energy levels from Whoop/Oura, water intake, sleep) via custom skills/heartbeats. The agent aggregates it into insights, then displays on a central dashboard with visuals like an "Energy Bar" that updates dynamically and sends low-energy alerts.
Multi-Agent / Orchestration Views
If you're running several agents (personal, work, trading bot, etc.), a unified dashboard to switch contexts, assign tasks, monitor status, and coordinate them (e.g., one agent scrapes data, another analyzes, third acts). Some call this "Mission Control" style—there's even a GitHub repo for an AI Agent Orchestration Dashboard built on the Gateway.
Server / Infrastructure Health Monitoring
For VPS/self-hosted setups: live graphs for CPU/RAM/disk usage, Docker container status, Tailscale connectivity, SSL cert expiry, fail2ban logs, cron job health, and gateway uptime. One user built a simple Python + vanilla HTML/JS version and shared screenshots—great for peace of mind when the agent has shell access.
Token & Cost Breakdown with Alerts
Beyond the dedicated cost monitors, integrate it natively or via plugins: per-session/model/channel breakdowns, daily/weekly trends, budget caps with proactive warnings ("You're at 80% of your $20 daily limit—pause heavy skills?").
Custom Visual Widgets & Casting
Agents that auto-generate HTML dashboards (e.g., life summary, task timeline) and cast them to TVs, e-ink displays, or Home Assistant tiles. Community examples include agents discovering devices on your network and pushing dynamic views.
Improved UX Overhauls
The default UI gets complaints about hanging chats, poor navigation, and feeling like an old ERP system. People are vibe-coding modern replacements (Next.js + Tailwind/Shadcn) with better search, dark mode, mobile responsiveness, and quicker reloads. One dev is open-sourcing "THE dashboard" for the community.
Security-Focused Additions
Given the powerful access (shell, files, APIs), extras like audit trails for every command/permission grant, suspicious skill flagging, and easy sandbox toggles show up in hardened setups.

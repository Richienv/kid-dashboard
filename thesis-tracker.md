# Thesis Tracker \n
## Purpose\n- Bantu Richie move from zero to drafted thesis \n- Provide structure + recurring prompts so he never wonders "what now"\n- Record answers/notes for each section so pieces can be woven later\n\n## Tracker structure\n1. **Thesis Theme + Goal**\n   - Topic statement (what is thesis about?)\n   - Value proposition / why this matters for Richie\n   - Primary research question(s)\n\n2. **Weekly Sprint Log**\n   - Date / Week #\n   - Focus (e.g., literature review, methodology sketch, data plan)\n   - Action items (tasks to complete before next check-in)\n   - Support needed (what Richie needs help with next)\n   - Instant wins / blockers\n\n3. **Section Drafting Table**\n   | Section | Status | Inputs collected | Notes / quotes | Next step |\n   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n   - Example: `Chapter 1: Problem Statement` status `Not started`, inputs `notes from SOUL.md + Web`, next step `auto prompt for framing questions.`\n\n4. **Ongoing Questions (auto-filled)**\n- "Richie, what data/chunks just landed that should go into the thesis?"\n- "Which structure pillar needs evidence this week?"\n- "What would make +5% progress by next update?"\n\n## Automation idea\n- Every Buddy check-in (cron job) append answer to Weekly Sprint Log in this file (or a dedicated `memory/` entry)\n- Add script `thesis-guide.sh` that reads this file, picks current focus, and asks relevant prompts (maybe combine with `buddy question`).\n\n## Next steps for me\n1. Keep this file updated with new insights from our chats\n2. Create prompt templates that map to sections (problem, related work, method) and rerun them every few days\n3. Help compile answers into Notion or next commit for thesis deliverables\n
